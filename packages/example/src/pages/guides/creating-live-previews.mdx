title: Creating live previews
---

Doctocat can render fenced code blocks as live previews with editable code using [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live). To make a code block render as an editable example, add a `live` attribute after the language:

````markdown
```jsx live
<button>Hello, world!</button>
```
````

Here's how the above example will render on a page:

```jsx live
<button>Hello, world!</button>
```

## Scope

You can add variables to the global scope of live previews by [shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/) `src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/live-code-scope.js`:

```js
// src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/live-code-scope.js
import {Box} from '@primer/components'

export default {
  Box,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
}
```

Every property on the object exported by `live-code-scope.js` will be available as a variable in the code:

````markdown
```jsx live
<Box p={3}>{text}</Box>
```
````
