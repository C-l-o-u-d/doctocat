title: Changing the Favicon
---

If you want to override the default favicon, you can pass a relative path to a custom icon as a theme option in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat',
      options: {
        icon: './src/images/custom-icon-512.png', // This path is relative to the root of the site.
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Doctocat uses [`gatsby-plugin-manifest`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest/) to generate a pre-configured set of icons from your image. For best results, if you’re providing an icon for generation, it should be…

- at least 512x512 pixels.
- square. If it’s not, transparent bars will be added to make it square.
- of one of the following formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, GIF or SVG.
