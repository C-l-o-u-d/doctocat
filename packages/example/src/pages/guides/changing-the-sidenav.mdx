title: Changing the sidenav
---

Side navigation for your site is generated from the content in `src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/nav.yml`. Edit that file to change your sidenav. Each entry in `nav.yml` should have a `title`, `url`, and an optional `items` list to create nested navigation links:

```yml
# src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/nav.yml
- title: Example
  url: /example
  items:
    - title: Example 2
      url: /example/example-2
```
