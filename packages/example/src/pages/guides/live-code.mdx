title: Live code

Doctocat can render code blocks as live previews with editable code using [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live). To make a code block render as an editable example, add a `live` attribute after the language:

````markdown
```jsx live
<button>Hello, world!</button>
```
````

Here's how the above example will render on a page:

```jsx live
<button>Hello, world!</button>
```

## Scope

Before you can use components or other variables in live code blocks, you'll need to add them to the global scope of live previews. Otherwise, the live previews will display a `ReferenceError`, like this:

```jsx live
// `Foo` was not added to the global scope of live previews
<Foo>Hello, world!</Foo>
```

You can add variables to the global scope of live previews by [shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/) `src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/live-code-scope.js`:

```js
// src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/live-code-scope.js
import {Box} from '@primer/components'

export default {
  Box,
  text: 'Hello, world!',
}
```

Every property on the object exported by `live-code-scope.js` will be available as a variable in the code:

````markdown
```jsx live
<Box p={3}>{text}</Box>
```
````
