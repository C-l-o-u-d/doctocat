title: Deployment
---

When you build your Doctocat site using [`gatsby build`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/#build), the output is static content: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. This content is incredibly easy and affordable to host with any provider but we recommend using [Now](https://zeit.co/now).

## Deploying to Now

If you started with the [Doctocat template](https://github.com/primer/doctocat-template), your site is already configured to deploy with Now. You're ready to set up the [Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/github) integration. If you did _not_ start with the Doctocat template, before you set up the Now for Github integration, you'll need to create a `now.json` file and add a `now-build` script to `package.json`:

```json
// now.json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "my-site",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@now/static-build",
      "config": {"distDir": "public"}
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "now-build": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

Once your site has the necessary configuration files and scripts, you can enable the Now for GitHub integration. You'll need to create a Now account, connect your GitHub account, then enable the integration for your repository. Check out the [Now for GitHub docs](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) for more detailed instructions.

After you have the GitHub integration set up, you should be able to access your site from a prefixed `.now.sh` domain.

## Deploying to other providers

Check out Gatsby's [Deploying and Hosting](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-and-hosting/) guides for more information about deploying to other providers.

## Adding a primer.style path alias

To make your site available from `primer.style/my-site`, you'll have to first add a `pathPrefix` field in your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```diff
module.exports = {
  ...
+ pathPrefix: '/my-site',
}
```

Check out [Gatsby's pathPrefix docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/) for more information.

After your `pathPrefix` is set up, open a pull request on the [primer/primer.style](https://github.com/primer/primer.style) repository to add your site to the [rules.json](https://github.com/primer/primer.style/blob/master/rules.json) file:

```diff
{
  "rules": [
    {"pathname": "/components**", "dest": "primer-components.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/css**", "dest": "primer-css.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/design**", "dest": "primer-design.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/blueprints**", "dest": "primer-blueprints.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/presentations**", "dest": "primer-presentations.now.sh"},
+   {"pathname": "/my-site**", "dest": "my-site.now.sh"},
    {"dest": "primer-style.now.sh"}
  ]
}
```

Once your pull request is approved and merged, you should be able to access your site from `primer.style/my-site`!
