This guide will walk you through creating, customizing, and deploying a new site with Doctocat using our [template repository](https://github.com/primer/doctocat-template). If you have an existing repository where you would like to create a new site, we recommend using the Gatsby CLI instead. Check out the [Gatsby CLI guide](/guides/gatsby-cli) for more information.

## 1. Create a new repository from the template

Use the [Doctocat template](https://github.com/primer/doctocat-starter) to create a new repository. Check out "[Creating a repository from a template](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)" for more information about using template repositories.

Your new repository will contain a few important files and directories:

- `gatsby-config.js`: This is your [Gatsby configuration](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/), where you can specify information about your site (such as title and description), and any additional [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/).
- `src/`: This directory will contain all of your site's content and any supporting files such as assets and custom React components.
  - `pages/`: This is where you will spend most of your time writing documentation. Markdown files (`.md` or `.mdx`) in `src/pages/` will be interpreted as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a combination of standard Markdown and [React JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html). Each document [becomes a page]((https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/#creating-pages) on your site with a URL based on its path relative to `src/pages/`.
  - `@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/`: You can use this directory to customize the look and behavior of the theme. All files placed in this directory will "shadow" files in the `src` directory of the Doctocat theme. Check out "[What is Component Shadowing?](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-04-29-component-shadowing/)" for more information.
- `package.json`: This file contains metadata like the project's name, repository, and a list of packages the project depends on. Check out the [package.json docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) for more information.
- `now.json`: When using [Now](https://zeit.co/now) to deploy, the configuration for your deployment is read from this file. Check out the [now.json docs](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration/?query=now.json) for more information. Feel free to delete this file if you do not plan to deploy your site with Now.

## 2. Update your site metadata

After you've created the repository, you'll want to customize the information about your site. Start by replacing the site metadata in the `gatsby-config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    name: 'Doctocat Template',
    description: 'My site description.',
  },
}
```

Next, open the `package.json` file and update the `name` and `repository` field:

```json
{
  "name": "doctocat-template",
  "repository": "primer/doctocat-template",
  ...
}
```

You'll also want to update the `name` field in the `now.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "doctocat-template"
  ...
}
```

## 3. Add your content

`src/pages` is where you'll put all the content for your site. Markdown files in `src/pages` automatically become pages with paths based on their file name. For example, if you create a `src/pages/components/box.md` file, Gatsby will use the content of that file to create a `/components/box` page. 

## 4. Update navigation

Side navigation for your site is generated from the content in `src/@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat/nav.yml`. After you've put your documents in `src/pages/`, you'll want to update that `nav.yml` file:

```yml
- title: Example
  url: '/example'
  items:
    - title: Example 2
      url: '/example/example-2'
```

## 5. Deploy to Now

After you've customized the content of your site, you're ready to deploy. There are many ways to deploy your site but we recommend using Now. The easiest way to deploy to Now is with their GitHub integration. Follow the steps in the [Now for Github docs](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) to learn how to set up the integration.

Once you have the GitHub integration set up, you should be able to access your site from a prefixed `.now.sh` domain.

## 6. Set up primer.style path alias

To make your site available from `primer.style/my-site`, you'll have to first add a `pathPrefix` field in your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  ...
  pathPrefix: '/my-site',
}
```

Check out [Gatsby's pathPrefix docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/) for more information.

After your `pathPrefix` is set up, open a pull request on the [primer/primer.style](https://github.com/primer/primer.style) repository to add your site to the [rules.json](https://github.com/primer/primer.style/blob/master/rules.json) file.

```diff
{
  "rules": [
    {"pathname": "/components**", "dest": "primer-components.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/css**", "dest": "primer-css.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/design**", "dest": "primer-design.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/blueprints**", "dest": "primer-blueprints.now.sh"},
    {"pathname": "/presentations**", "dest": "primer-presentations.now.sh"},
+   {"pathname": "/my-site**", "dest": "my-site.now.sh"},
    {"dest": "primer-style.now.sh"}
  ]
}
```

Once your pull request is approved and merged, you should be able to access your site at `primer.style/my-site`! ðŸŽ‰
