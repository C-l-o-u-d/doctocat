title: Frontmatter

import {StatusLabel} from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat'

When you create a Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) in `src/pages/`, you can define variables to provide additional information about that page. This information is called frontmatter and is set between triple dashes starting on the first line of the file:

```
---
title: Example title
---
```

Doctocat recognizes some specific frontmatter variables described below.

## Title and description

`title` is used to render the page heading and generate the [page title](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title). `description` is used to create a [meta description tag](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) which is important for SEO. We recommend setting `title` and `description` for every page:

```markdown
---
title: My page title
description: My page description
---
```

## Status

You can add a status label to any page by setting a `status` variable in the frontmatter:

```markdown
---
status: Stable
---
```

Doctocat comes with a few predefined statuses that have colors associated with them:

| Status         | Output                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Stable`       | <StatusLabel status="Stable" />       |
| `New`          | <StatusLabel status="New" />          |
| `Experimental` | <StatusLabel status="Experimental" /> |
| `Review`       | <StatusLabel status="Review" />       |
| `Deprecated`   | <StatusLabel status="Deprecated" />   |

Custom statuses will render a gray dot:

<StatusLabel status="My custom status" />
