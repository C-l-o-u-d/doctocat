title: Front matter
---

import {StatusLabel} from '@primer/gatsby-theme-doctocat'

In any markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) in `src/pages/`, you can add front matter to provide additional information about the page. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid [YAML](https://yaml.org/) set between triple-dashed lines:

```
---
title: Example title
---
```

Between these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for reference).

## Title and description

`title` is used to render the page heading and generate the [page title](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title). `description` is used to create a [meta description tag](https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description) which is important for SEO. We recommend setting `title` and `description` for every page:

```markdown
---
title: My page title
description: My page description
---
```

## Status

You can add a status label to any page by setting the `status` variable in the front matter:

```markdown
---
status: Stable
---
```

Doctocat comes with a few predefined statuses with that have colors associated with them:

| Status         | Output                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Stable`       | <StatusLabel status="Stable" />       |
| `New release`  | <StatusLabel status="New release" />  |
| `Experimental` | <StatusLabel status="Experimental" /> |
| `In review`    | <StatusLabel status="In review" />    |
| `Deprecated`   | <StatusLabel status="Deprecated" />   |

Custom statuses will render a gray dot:

<StatusLabel status="My custom status" />
