The caption component can be used to append a caption to images used in documentation.

```jsx live
<Flex alignItems="center" flexDirection="column">
  <img alt="A beautiful husky puppy with blue eyes staring at the camera." src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos.puppyspot.com/breeds/245/card/500000291_medium.jpg" />
  <Caption>A beautiful husky puppy.</Caption>
</Flex>
```

_Note: Be sure to include an ```alt``` attribute on your image in addition to your caption._
